Computer Networks end semester project - semester 5.

In the light of the ongoing pandemic, the remote desktop has got towering levels of importance due to restriction of movement. Many organizations and workplaces are having to rethink the way they work. Remote access is a way to connect to other devices or networks that are miles apart, and can still work efficiently. No work needs to wait because of the user not being able to be present there physically. 
Being able to access remote computers opens new doors in maintenance and security. A small vulnerability in the connection can cause damage to the remote system through man-in-the-middle attacks, without the knowledge of the client. Or, if the security to establish a connection is not good, there is a chance that unidentified users can log in to the remote system as a client and cause permanent damage to the remote system. Ensuring security in all angles is crucial for remote access to work at it’s full potential.


# Why remote access?
For any business to succeed in today’s competitive world, they need to improve the productivity and efficiency of the workforce by choosing smarter ways to work. The way technology is used plays a major role. Work being done from anywhere in the world and anytime is the ultimate power.


- Easy and remote troubleshooting
With remote access, troubleshooting can be done from anywhere in the world or just across the table. It helps the technicians to identify problems quickly and it is more comfortable to access the user’s desktop for solving the issue than to try to solve it by voice or video call.


- Work from anywhere freedom to employees
This adds flexibility to the workspace. The employee can work from the comfort of their homes, or from anywhere in the world in case of emergency. The files in the system at the office can be easily accessed and work can be continued. 


- Easy collaboration
The basic features and idea of remote access improves collaboration by providing tools such as files and resource sharing, and easy troubleshooting.


- Cost effective.
Suppose, there is an expensive software installed on a system, or the system has advanced hardware for computation that needs to be performed. Many employees can share this system at the same time, or different times, from different locations! The cost of installing extra infrastructure and travel is largely minimized.


- Eco friendly!
The need for users to be physically present at the location reduces travel needs. This reduces carbon emissions, energy and fuel consumption, leading to a sustainable future.

# Basic overview

There are two basic applications that communicate with each other - client and server. The client requests permission from the server to use the system. If accepted and the connection is successful, the server starts sharing it’s screen to the client and is ready to start receiving commands from the client. At this point, the client is also ready to receive the screen from the server and send commands to the server.
